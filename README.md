# TaskBar64

TaskBar64 is a lightweight, closed-source freeware utility for macOS that provides classic Windows-style taskbar behavior while working alongside the Dock.

It displays each open window as a separate button with its title, allowing fast and precise window switching — especially useful when working with many terminals, editors, or documents at the same time.

## Features
- Shows individual windows (not grouped by application)
- Displays window titles directly on the taskbar
- Works alongside the macOS Dock (does not replace it)
- One-click window switching
- Native macOS application
- Free to use

## Why TaskBar64?
macOS provides powerful window management tools, but when working with many open windows — such as multiple VS Code projects, SSH sessions, or documents — quickly identifying and switching to a specific window can be difficult.

TaskBar64 solves this by offering a simple, always-visible taskbar that complements the Dock instead of replacing it.

## Requirements
- macOS
- The Dock must be positioned at the bottom and not hidden
